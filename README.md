----------
Library for use in 2D drawing/game applications. Consists of multiple renderers (only backing and full canvas working ATM), a cartesian coordinate system, resizing of windows (canvases) and viewport / world coordinate mapping system.

Demo
----
Included a demo app which uses an awesome rendering of the DOOM logo as semi-transparent colored polygons generated by https://github.com/jacovanniekerk/gapaint.git.

To run the demo app, just do (depending on your python version)


    python -m http.server
(if you're on python 3)

or

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer

(if you're on python < 3)
